              <h2>Christian's tips for yourg filmmakers</h2>
               <h3>The best adn only way to become a filmmaker is to just go and do it</h3>
                  <p>
                 It’s not something you can learn in a classroom, the only way you’ll improve is by actually filming and
                editing in the real world. Everyone has access to a HD camera these days, iPhones shoot in 4K resolution
                which is insane. Almost every laptop or computer comes with free video editing software and if yours
                doesn’t, there are plenty of free ones you can download online. There’s nothing stopping you from going
                out and making something. Whether you get your friends to act in a short film, you make a short
                documentary about someone or something interesting in your area, you film people skating or dancing or
                playing music like I did, there’s always something to film. The more you film, the better you’ll get, your eye
                will improve, you’ll start seeing shots better and you’ll improve very quickly if you put the time in. Don’t be
                afraid to experiment and try different things. There’s no such thing as a right way to do things.

              <article class="row">
                <h3>Find someone in the industry who does what you want to do and ask them can they help you</h3>
                  <p>
                You can find anyone’s email on the internet. Someone in the industry might meet you for a cup of coffee to
                give you advice, they might let you assist them to gain experience, or if you’re lucky they might even give
                you work experience on a production they work on. I met David Caffrey, director of Love/Hate and I asked
                him if he could help me in any way and he brought me on set of Love/Hate twice, introducing me to the
                cast, showing me how things are done and letting me watch him direct the show. If you don’t put yourself
                out there and ask for help then it’ll be way more difficult for you to progress. Everyone needs help in the
                beginning. Don’t be afraid of being ignored or told no, if someone says no then you’re no worse off than
                you were before or if you hadn’t asked.

                <h2>Watch youtube tutorials</h2>
                  <p>
                Lots of them. Almost everything you can learn in film school can be learned on YouTube for free in a
                fraction of the time. Some good places to start are Film Riot for effects and techniques, and Philip Bloom
                for knowledge about equipment. I learned almost everything I know from YouTube. There are hundreds of
                episodes of Film Riot so you can learn basically anything you need to know. Casey Neistat is an amazing
                filmmaker to learn from on YouTube too, definitely check him out.Take inspiration from other filmmakers,
                but never copy. There’s a difference. When you’re starting out it can be very helpful to try and copy what
                other people do as a practice exercise to learn techniques, and that’s fine, but never blatantly copy other
                people’s ideas
                  </p>
              </article>
              <article class="row">
                <h2>Put yourself out there</h2>
                  <p>
                Search the internet for other young people interested in filmmaking and make friends with them. Go to
                events and festivals like Fresh to meet other filmmakers. You won’t be amazing at everything, if you love
                directing but hate sound and editing, you’re sure to find other people your age who are great at those
                things. Filmmaking isn’t a solo activity, you need others to make it work. It’s not as fun by yourself either.

                <p>"I wanted to get involved with a project like this because
                    of the massive environmental problems that face our
                    planet and are worsening everyday. This competition is
                    a great way to get the next generation of adults and
                    potential leaders thinking about the importance of
                    saving our environment and hopefully acting upon it. Of
                    course we can only start small that’s why The Story of
                    Your Stuff makes sense. If everybody embraced
                    responsibility for their own stuff then collectively we can
                    make a bigger and more positive impact on our world. I
                    really had fun making this video - I loved that this was a
                    real challenge for me, being quite different to what I

                  to be global megastars, Macklemore & Ryan Lewis, helping to introduce them to a wider Irish audience for
                  the first time. Two years later, Christian discovered the then up and coming singer-songwriter James Bay
                  and filmed the first ever recording of his song Let It Go which has since gone on to be a global hit. As a
                  result and despite his age, Christian has already gained extensive experience in the music industry
