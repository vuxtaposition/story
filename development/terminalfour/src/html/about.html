          <h2>Story of your stuff</h2>
              <p>
                Let’s get thinking about… stuff! Chances are most of the items you use on a daily basis began their life as
                something else. The Story of Your Stuff is all about thinking about where your stuff comes from and
                becoming more aware of the the life cycle of products and the transformations they go through along the
                way. By becoming more aware of the ‘story of your stuff’ you begin to understand why recycling and using
                recyclable materials on a daily basis is so important.
